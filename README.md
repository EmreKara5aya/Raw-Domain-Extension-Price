# Raw Domain Prices
This Repo aim to provide visibility of information on Raw/Actual/At-Cost/Real domain extension prices. 
Visit the pricing table here: 
- [Cloudflare TLDs domain pricing dump](./scrap-cloudflare-domain-pricing/cloudflare-domain-pricing-dump.csv) from Cloudflare registrar API. Updated (August 2022). Checkout [that folder](./scrap-cloudflare-domain-pricing/) to learn more.

Might be useful for:
- To make sure you are not overcharged by your Domain Registry.
- To know how much Domain Registry is marking up prices.
- To know which domain extension is most cost effective
- etc

Domain price are so obsecured, I can hardly find what is the real price of a domain. 
Domain registry make it worse by sometimes using bait-and-switch strategy offering cheap 1st year registration, then jacking up the price beyond the real price.
It's time for us to really know (or atleast approximate) how much we should be paying for.

# Outdated Stuff

<details>
<summary>Outdated stuff</summary>

Below are some outdated info, these are from early days when I created this repo.

## Pricing List
- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ir4dNM_BYajBzBMELzd4PDIkuNW4eB1y7p271JIwW5I/edit?usp=sharing
- Or Sort by cheapest: 
    - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ir4dNM_BYajBzBMELzd4PDIkuNW4eB1y7p271JIwW5I/edit#gid=963044171 (mobile friendly)
    - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ir4dNM_BYajBzBMELzd4PDIkuNW4eB1y7p271JIwW5I/edit#gid=0&fvid=273180247 (desktop only, Gsheet filter-view only works on Gsheet desktop)
- Or [click here](/domain_prices.csv) to visit Github's CSV viewer, which also have search feature!

## Mechanism
- It scrap pricing information from this repo: `https://github.com/judge2020/Actual-Domain-Prices/` which is compiled by @judge2020 from Cloudflare API.
- it scrap pricing information from : `https://domaincostclub.com/pricing.dhtml`
- it use Google Spreadsheet to present the tabular data. 
- It use Google Spreadhseet capability to use Google App Script, as backend/engine to scrap the data. 
    - So I can trigger it easily from GSheet, without any dedicated backend.
    - Yes I aim to be as backendless as possible, leveraging any off-the-shelf popular free online service, like Google App Script.
- Due to its scraping nature, it may break someday if the data source introduce significant changes.
- UPDATE: potential issue:
    - The HTTP proxy used on that script seems to be dead.
    - The repo mentioned on 1st point seems to be deleted.
    - So the script is no longer working. Checkout [this folder](./scrap-cloudflare-domain-pricing/) instead.

## Other
- The Google App Script based script is available as: `scrapPrices.js` in the repo.
    - If you want to use it on your own GSheet, here's the step:
        - Create new Google Spreadhseet
        - Click on toolbar `tools > script editor`
        - Paste the script, save.
        - Refresh your browser tab that open the Gsheet.
        - You now will find on toolbar `extra menu > Scrap Domain Prices`
        - You may be asked for permission to execute it. Allow it.
- The scraped pricing data is exported as `.csv` in the repo (although not realtime updated, please visit the GSheet URL for most updated one)

## TODO
- create simple Html/web frontend interface to easily sort/search the table.

## Disclaimer
- On Cloudflare data source, read [disclaimer stated by `judge2020` here](https://github.com/judge2020/Actual-Domain-Prices/#disclaimer)
- On DomainCostClub data source, they [said](https://www.domaincostclub.com/pricing.dhtml): `Our Pricing. No Markup, Ever. ... Domain Cost Club Members are guaranteed at-cost pricing.`
    - Though we can't be 100% sure with their claim.
- On some domains that is found within both sources, there are some price differences between DomainCostClub pricing (seems more expensive) & Cloudflare. Maybe DCC still markup the domain price ??? or they used different pricing source, etc.
